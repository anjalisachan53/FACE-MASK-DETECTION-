# FACE-MASK-DETECTION-
Problem Statement-COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, and the WHO and other health agencies have recommended that people use face masks to prevent its transmission. All governments are attempting to guarantee that face masks are worn in public places, but it is difficult to manually identify those who are not wearing face masks in crowded places. Scientists are working on developing automatic methods to identify and enforce the use of face masks in public locations. The problem may be summarized as follows: given a face picture as an input, the classification model must categorize the facial image in a mask detection task using the classification model.We provide a method for mask detection-driven face picture classification that is both fast and accurate, as demonstrated in this work.
